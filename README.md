Answers to problem sets on Kattis

These are all successful submissions to problem sets on Kattis.com. I began this as a Freshman CS student with
limited programming knowledge prior to starting school. While these answers are all correct, I am sure there
are more efficient ways of completing them, which is why I occasionally go back and re-work some of these. If I have done that they update is marked with comments explaining what was done. If you have a better way of doing any of these, or have any questions,
feel free to message me!
